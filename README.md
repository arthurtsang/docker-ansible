# Run Ansible from a Docker image

This image allows you to run Ansible without installing it on your local machine.

It assumes:
- The Ansible playbooks are located somewhere within the users home directory
- SSH keys end with `_rsa`

## Aliases

These aliases can be used to have the Ansible Docker image behave like a local installation of Ansible

```bash
alias ansible='docker run -it --rm -m 128m -v ${HOME}:${HOME}:ro -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/ssh:ro -w ${PWD} cargonauts/ansible ansible'
alias ansible-playbook='docker run -it --rm -m 128m -v ${HOME}:${HOME}:ro -v ${HOME}/.ssh:/ssh:ro -w ${PWD} cargonauts/ansible ansible-playbook'
```
